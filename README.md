# DTFAutomaticCellHeight
DTFAutomaticCellHeight is a Swift implementation of the iOS8 automatic cell height functionality. This functionality allows UITableViewCells to dynamically determine their height at runtime without having to implement delegate and perform the calculations to determine the Cell's height. If you have the AutoLayout constraints setup correctly the UITableView will take care of setting up the necessary heights for you.
